Lectures, labs, homeworks and readings for ER131: Data, Environment and Society

This course will teach students to build, estimate and interpret models that describe phenomena in the broad area of energy and environmental decision-making. Students leave the course as both critical consumers and responsible producers of data-driven analysis.

The effort will be divided between (i) learning a suite of data-driven modeling and prediction tools (including linear model selection methods, classification and regression trees and support vector machines) (ii) building the programming and computing expertise to use those tools and (iii) developing the ability to formulate and answer resource allocation questions within energy and environment contexts.

We will work in Python in this course, and students must have taken Data 8 before enrolling. The course is designed to complement and reinforce Berkeleyâ€™s data science curriculum, in particular Data 100.
