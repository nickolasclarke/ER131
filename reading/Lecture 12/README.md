### Lecture 12 reading

Novotny *et al*, "National Satellite-Based Land-Use Regression: NO2 in the United States,", Environmental Science and Technology (2011).

The paper is very technical and will take you a long time to digest if you read everything.  I'd like you to focus on the following questions:

1. Describe the basic model selection process and how it differs from AIC (which we learned briefly in class on Thursday).  This question can be answered if you read Section 2.2 and 2.3 carefully and do a little background research to understand unfamiliar terms. 

2. The authors compare R2 values for the test data versus R2 for the training data.  What do they obeserve?  What does this imply about their data and model?  Read Section 3.3 to answer this question.  
3. Also in section 3.3 the authors state "We also investigated the extent to which monitor locations span the (independent) variable space, an important issue for any LUR".  What does this mean?  Why is spanning the variable space important?

4. The authors discuss several limitations in the Discussion section.  Review these.  How important are their limitations?  Are there others you think are worth considering?
