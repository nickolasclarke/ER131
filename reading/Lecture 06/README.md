### Lecture 6 reading

Read the following -- you don't need to understand the details of the methods, but rather the framing, problem being solved, and conclusions.  

1. Hino *et al*, "Machine learning for environmental monitoring," *Nature Sustainability* (2018). 
2. Pelletier *et al* "Predicting plant conservation priorities on a global scale", *PNAS* (2018).

Questions to focus on:
1. What is the prediction question?  Are the authors making predictions across space, time, or some other dimension?
2. What is the key policy application?
2. Name two or more factors readers should take into consideration as they interpret and implement the results.  These could relate to error propogation, causal inference or other factors.
