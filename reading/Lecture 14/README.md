### Lecture 14 Reading

- For Lecture 14 we'll cover regularization and shrinkage methods.  Please read Ch 6.1-6.2
- Also we'll discuss the human side of machine learning.  Read [this New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/16/technology/ai-humans.html) on the human side to training machine learning classifiers.  Some questions to ponder:
	- How is the work described relevant to prediction problems?  
	- Is the work described in this article is a "necessary evil" in the sense that the upside reward to having so many images classified is far greater than the cost to individual workers?
	- Do you agree with the sentiment in this quote: "The work is easily misunderstood, said Ms. Gray, the Microsoft anthropologist. Listening to people cough all day may be disgusting, but that is also how doctors spend their days. 'We donâ€™t think of that as drudgery,' she said."
