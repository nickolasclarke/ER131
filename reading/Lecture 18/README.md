### Lecture 18 Reading

For Lecture 18 we'll:
- cover classification trees.  Please read ISLR 8.1-8.2.
- discuss environmental justice.  Please read Manuel Pastor's article from the book *Reclaiming Nature*, in this folder.

Questions to contemplate for Pastor:

1. What's the difference between environmental racism and environmental justice, framed as "a positive concept of equal access to environmental goods"?  What are some of the ways Pastor suggests achieving the latter? 
2. How have the environmental and EJ movements differed in their histories?
3. Discuss some of Pastor's summarized results, and his assertion that there is a "problem of disproportionate exposure by race and class" and his claim that this exposure is the outcome of power in decision making rather than "efficient" market outcomes.  What are the strengths and weaknesses in his claim?
