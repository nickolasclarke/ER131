    "Now that we are able to get our hour data and our sampled California cities and towns, it's time to run the KNN algorithm. The first step to running KNN is to find the distance between our locations fo interest (California cities and towns) and our locations where PM2.5 is measured. Both the hour data and the grid contain latitude and longitude coordinates. Let's take advantage of that by defining a function that finds the distance between any two points given each point's latitude and longitude values, which will help us when comparing nearest distances. We can use the Euclidean distance formula, which says that if we have one set of points $(a_1,b_1)$, and another set of points $(a_2,b_2)$, the distance between them is:<br>\n",

Since we're calculating distances over a relatively small area (the state of California), we can use the approximation above. If you wanted to accurately look at distances between latitude-longitude pairs over a larger area of the globe, you would have to use a slightly more involved trigonometry formula."

    "Now that we've tried producing a multiple regression model, we can think about model selection. Model selection can be thought of the process of choosing a subset of variables, but in order to do so, we first need a benchmark to compare different models. And given the benchmark, we also need a search strategy: how are we going to systematically include or exclude different variables in our model, and then calculate the benchmark values for those models? With a limited number a predictors, we are able to search all possible models (i.e. including all combinations of predictor variables). One way to assess a model is using the Aikake Information Criterion ($\\text{AIC}$).\n",

Depending on the data that we use in our model - in this case, the data associated with the features we add - AIC may be used to tell us how our model performs with the data given. Sometimes adding more data (features) improves the quality, sometimes it doesn't. Other times adding the right features may improve the quality.\n",

    "The smaller $\\text{AIC}$ is, the greater the model performs (one way to think about it is: if AIC is small, that means the likelihood function is high - there's a high likelihood that the coefficients predict the observed $y$ value. And if we have one model that uses less features, and another that uses more features, but they have the same likelihood function, then the model that uses less features has a smaller AIC value - so AIC defines models that have a high probability of predicting the observed values, while using less features when possible,as high quality models).\n",
