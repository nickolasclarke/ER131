    "# [ERG 131] Homework 9: Classification\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "This homework will build on the methods introduced in lab 9 that predict qualitative variables. Besides logistic regression and KNN, which were explored in lab 9, decision trees are another powerful prediction method and are easy to interpret. A decision tree can explain exactly why a specific prediction was made. As we'll see in this lab, using a single decision tree to make a prediction often isn't the best performing method. However, ensemble methods such as random forests and bagging use multiple trees to reach a \"consensus\" decision, and typically perform better than single decision trees. In this homework, we'll start by building a single decision tree and then see how ensemble methods perform by comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trees are, overall, a relatively accessible method for predictive modeling since they are used for both regression and classification and can take in both continuous and categorical data. Decision trees are covered in sections 8.1-8.3 of ISLR.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework, we'll be doing a brief exploration of the CalEnviroScreen dataset, testing out how to make a tree from scratch, as well as implementing various ensemble methods using scikit-learn. It'll be a comprehensive survey of trees and the multitude of algorithms that arise from one tree!\n",

In this section, we'll use the same criterion that scikit-learn uses when checking the \"quality\" of a split: the Gini index (also called Gini impurity). A low Gini index score indicates a near perfect split, and a high score means the composition of classes is nearly the same in both groups.\n",

Let's say we create a split where any census tracts where Groundwater Threats < 3 are on one branch (branch #1), and any census tracts where Groundwater Threats are >= 3 are on another branch (branch #2). If branch #1 consists of only tracts in the highest percentile range, and branch #2 consists of only tracts in the lowest percentile range, this is a perfect split and will get a low Gini index for both branches. However, if branch #1 has a 50/50 split of tracts, and so does branch #2 (i.e. there are both high percentile and low percentile tracts with Groundwater Threats >= 3), then this is a pretty bad split that doesn't really help with classification, and it will get a high Gini index score for both branches.\n",

Throughout the lab, we'll be training models on `X_train` and `y_train` and using `X_val` and `y_val` to tune their parameters. Then, at the very very end, we'll look at how each model performs on `X_test` and `y_test`. Because we'll be doing cross-validation in some but not all cases, we're reserving the 'validation' data set now that will be used for benchmarking as we go along.  But in practice it's acting like a static test data set; the error reported from the validation data set is different from cross-validated error. "

You may have noticed that, although the training scores were extremely high, the validation scores usually weren't as high. This is where ensemble methods come in, namely bagging, random forests, and boosting. We call them \"ensemble methods\" because we fit many trees and we somehow aggregate the models to avoid overfitting - in bagging, for example, we take an average of models. The benefits of using ensemble methods may not be immediately apparent with the training and validation data, but might become clearer when we evaluate all our models on the test data at the end of the assignment.\n",
