    "In this notebook, you'll be working with data from the [California Public Utilities Commission](https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/fireincidentsdata/). The three California IOUs (PG&E, SCE, and SDGE) are required to report fire incidents to the CPUC, along with certain characteristics of the fire and the electrical system in the area.\n",

    "<br>**Question 1.1:** Look through the `data` folder and then load the .csv files into the homework so we can easily work with the data. These files were retrieved from the CPUC website, and small adjustments were made on Excel to make them easily retrievable in the notebook. The first example (PG&E) has been done for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look at the arguments that are passed to the `read_csv` function. First, we specify the file location. We also set  `index_col` to `False`.  This forces numbered indices.  As an alternative we could have passed a number to `index_col`; if we pass $n$ in, then pandas uses the $n+1^{\\text{st}}$ column of the csv as the index."
